## Deploying CONTAINERIZED ML Model using Flask
Project to containerize MaajidKhan's DeployMLModel-Flask

**NOTE: This project is merely for experimental and learning purposes, I am not trying to claim the original project as my own, all credits for the original app code go to the creator, MaajidKhan**

**ORIGINAL README BELOW**

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed.

Flask version: 0.12.2
conda install flask=0.12.2  (or) pip install Flask==0.12.2

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. model.py - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict employee salaries absed on trainign data in 'hiring.csv' file.
2. app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3. template - This folder contains the HTML template (index.html) to allow user to enter employee detail and displays the predicted employee salary.
4. static - This folder contains the css folder with style.css file which has the styling required for out index.html file.

### Running the project
1. Ensure that you are in the project home directory. Create the machine learning model by running below command from command prompt -
```
python model.py
```
This would create a serialized version of our model into a file model.pkl

2. Run app.py using below command to start Flask API
```
python app.py
```
By default, flask will run on port 5000.

3. Navigate to URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or) http://localhost:5000

You should be able to view the homepage.

Enter valid numerical values in all 3 input boxes and hit Predict.

If everything goes well, you should  be able to see the predcited salary vaule on the HTML page!
check the output here: http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
